              Bugs are curious creatures by nature, so it‚Äôs no surprise one once
              ventured into a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              That morning of September 1947, an adventurous moth crept into a
              CPU while looking for the light source. The software wasn't
              programmed to host organisms and sparked a new species and the
              spirit of the moth was passed into the network. For generations,
              computer nerds throughout the world considered a "bug" to be a
              glitch in an operating system. We now know what every software bug
              has always been, this new species of digital life: a scumbug, a
              digital descendant of the original moth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward thirty odd years and not only have computing machines
              greatly evolved, so have the Scumbugs. Six types of these
              computerized insectia, bred in the computer world, were ready to
              hatch.
            </p>
            <p>
              From January 1st, 1980 to the very end of the year 2021, a scumbug
              was born daily into cyberspace. Although different in allure, each
              shared the intrepid character of their mother-moth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, the Scumbugs are banding together in order to infest the
              blockchain. There, in hopes of looking the original scum in the
              eye, they‚Ä¶.

            <p>
              Scumbugs are a collection of 15,341 unique on-chain bugs infesting
              the Ethereum Network. Bred at the intersection of generative art
              and creative coding, each scumbug is generated with randomly
              seeded values, issued at the moment of an NFT mint transaction
              hash.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There are 6 species of Scumbugs: Mantis, Caterpillar, Snail,
                Mosquito, Fly, and Moth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each scumbug has a unique look - the result of a randomized
                combination of seven character attributes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each scumbug has a unique stare showcasing an exclusive
                generative work of art.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each scumbug has its own birthday, as all 15,341 insects emerged
                from their eggs between January 1st, 1980, and December 31st,
                2021.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each scumbug‚Äôs metadata is 100% stored on the Ethereum
                blockchain and its artwork is hosted permanently on the Arweave
                blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                341 Scumbugs will be reserved for giveaways, incentives for
                hirings, and other purposes that help grow and sustain the
                project.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Scumbugs collection and its digital universe is the genesis
                project of (lab name). Building a strong IP (intellectual
                property) for the Scumbugs universe will remain the top priority
                when exploring further cyber-ecosystem development.

                40% of the primary sales and 50% of the royalties will be
                redistributed to the Scumbugs community treasury, in order to
                finance its ever growing experience.
